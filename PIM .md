# Microsoft Cloud Administration with Entra (Azure)

## Overview
Welcome to my home lab setup, "Dashershomelab"! This environment is designed for learning and understanding various aspects of networking, monitoring, prevention, administration, and hardening techniques. It's been an incredible learning journey, and I'm excited to share my setup with you.

### Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security

**Enterprise Mobility + Security from Microsoft** is a comprehensive suite designed to help organizations manage and secure their mobile devices, applications, and data. EMS integrates with Microsoft's cloud services and provides a range of tools for identity and access management, information protection, and device management.

## Lab Focus: Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

In this lab, we will focus on understanding Privileged Identity Management (PIM). While exploring PIM, we will also touch upon various Microsoft cloud services, including:

- **Entra ID** (formerly known as Azure AD)
- **Intune**
- **Purview**
- **Microsoft 365**

### Privileged Identity Management + Security

As we all know, Azure AD has been renamed to Entra ID. Throughout this lab, I will refer to it as Entra ID to reflect this update.
